# Overview of the Project

 Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# TASK ONE: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

For this task, the World Population Dataset has been chosen, containing population data from 1970 to 2022 for countries worldwide. The task involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as *pandas, **numpy, **matplotlib, and **seaborn* to gain insights into the dataset.

# Key Activities:
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Ensured the dataset was free from inconsistencies, missing values, and any anomalies that could affect the analysis.
   
2. Exploration of Data Characteristics:
   - Inspected the dataset’s structure, dimensions, data types, and summary statistics using pandas.
   
3. Data Distribution Analysis:
   - Used *matplotlib* and *seaborn* to generate histograms for understanding the distribution of population values over the years across different countries.

4. Correlation Analysis:
   - Computed the correlation between population growth and various factors over time using *pandas*.
   - Visualized correlations with heatmaps to observe relationships between different variables.

5. Outlier Detection:
   - Identified outliers in population data using statistical methods, scatter plots, and box plots for deeper insights into anomalies.

6. Visualization of Findings:
   - Created scatter plots to observe population trends and distributions across different countries.
   - Generated heatmaps to visualize correlations between population figures for various years.
   - Utilized histograms to demonstrate the spread and distribution of population data across different regions and years.

 Tools Used:
pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
